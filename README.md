## Strategy
### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made

&nbsp;

### Strategy Description
|Item Description | Importance Score | Feasibility Score | Outcome |
| --------------- | ----------| -----------| ----------|
| <!-- ADD ITEM -->| <!-- ADD IMPORTANCE SCORE --> | <!-- ADD FESIBILITY SCORE --> | <!-- TOTAL OF IMPORTANCE & FEASIBILITY --> |
